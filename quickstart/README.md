# Hellō Quickstart

This package starts a local web server and launches the Hellō Quickstart Web App to create or retrieve the `client_id` for a Hellō Application.

## CLI

If you have Node.js >= v18, you can run Quickstart with: 
```sh
npx @hellocoop/quickstart@latest
```

This will prompt you to install the package if not already installed. It will then open up a browser window, where you will login with Hellō, and then choose to create a new app, or select an existing one, and then it will return the app's `client_id` to the console.
